Hello, I'm James.

I'm interested in improving healthcare by making the latest advances in the research world accessible to clinicians. 

I have a PhD in Medical Imaging from the [University of Oxford](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/) and currently lead the [Research Software Engineering Team](https://rse.diagnijmegen.nl) in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl) at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. 

In my spare time I run, cycle, and climb mountains.
