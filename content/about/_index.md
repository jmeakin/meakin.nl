Hello, I'm James.

I'm interested in improving healthcare by making the latest advances in the research world accessible to clinicians. I have a PhD in Medical Imaging from the [University of Oxford](http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) and currently work as a [Research Software Engineer](http://www.rse.ac.uk) in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl) at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. In my spare time I run, cycle, and climb mountains.
